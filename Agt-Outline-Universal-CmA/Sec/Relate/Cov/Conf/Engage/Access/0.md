sec=(Provisions regulating "access" to information.)

//=This is a somewhat unconventional approach, thought to be more rigorous.  "Access" can be distinguished from disclosure.  The difference is that persons within the circle of the Receiving Party "access" information.  The distinction partly reflects a notion of who the Receiving Party "is".  For instance, if the Receiving Party is a company, then the managers, officers, and perhaps advisors of the Receiving Party would be privy to Confidential Information if nothing further was said.
