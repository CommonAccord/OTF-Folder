/=To demonstrate the flexibility of Prose Objects, we now strengthen the treatment of Confidentiality by including the more extensive Confidentiality provisions and a more extensive definition of "Confidential Information."  We do that by referencing objects from the Agt-NDA-CmA form that originated with CooleyGo (but is substantially modified).  We override the definition of Confidential Information and the Section on Confidentiality.

/=We override by referencing the desired provisions:

Def.Confidential_Information.=[G/Agt-NDA-CmA/Sec/Def/Confidential_Information/0.md]

Conf.=[G/Agt-NDA-CmA/Sec/Relate/Conf/0.md]
