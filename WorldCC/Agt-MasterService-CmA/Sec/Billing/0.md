Ti=Billing and Payment

1.Ti=Acceptance

1.sec=The {_Customer} shall be deemed to accept the {_Service} unless the {_Customer} gives notice to {_Provider} within {ServiceRejectionNotice.TimeSpan} of the {_Service_Commencement_Date} that the {_Service} does not meet the technical specifications contained in any applicable {_SLA} or is otherwise in material non-compliance with the {_Agreement}.  If the {_Customer} provides such notice, then {_Provider} will test the {_Service} for non-compliance. If {_Provider} verifies the non-compliance, then {_Provider} shall, as the {_Customer}’s sole remedy, promptly take such action  as  is  necessary  to  correct  the  non-compliance and shall provide the {_Customer} with a new {_Service_Commencement_Date}.

2.Ti=Credit Approval

2.sec=Delivery of {_Service} is subject to credit approval. {_Provider} may, at any time, require the {_Customer} to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit drawn on a financial institution acceptable to {_Provider} or such other security as {_Provider} and the {_Customer} may agree upon to secure the {_Customer}’s payments during the {_Service_Term} of the {_Agreement}. The {_Customer} shall provide such requested security within 5 {_Business_Days} and {_Provider} shall not be required to deliver or continue to deliver any {_Service} until such security has been obtained.

3.Ti=Invoices and Payment

3.sec=Provision of the {_Service} is billable upon delivery and the {_Customer} shall be liable for all {_Charges} from the {_Service_Commencement_Date}. The {_Customer} will be invoiced: (a) monthly in advance for the recurring portion of the {_Charges}; and (b) monthly in arrears for any other {_Charges}. All non-recurring {_Charges} will be invoiced during the month in which they were incurred. All {_Charges} shall be due upon the {_Customer}’s receipt of the invoice and payable within {ChargesPaidWithin.TimeSpan} of the invoice date (without any deduction or set-off whatsoever save in any case of fraud or deceit on the part of {_Provider}). Billing for partial months will be prorated based on a calendar month.

4.Ti=Increase in Charges

4.sec=. {_Provider} shall have the right to increase the {_Charges} on each anniversary of the date of the {_Agreement} by giving to the {_Customer} at least 30 days notice, provided that any such increase shall not exceed a percentage equal to {MaxAnnualIncreaseInCharges.%} for the year either from the date of the {_Agreement} (in the case of the first such increase) or from the date on which the immediately preceding increase came into effect pursuant to this {Billing.Xref}.4 (in the case of subsequent increases).

5.Ti=Late Charges

5.sec=Any undisputed amount not paid to {_Provider} when due shall bear interest at {ChargesLatePaymentMonthlyInterestRate.%} per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, from the date payment falls due until payment is received by {_Provider}, both before and after judgement, such interest to be compounded monthly in arrears.

6.Ti=Disputed Charges

6.0.sec=The {_Customer} may, acting in good faith, dispute any portion of an invoice provided that the {_Customer}:

6.1.sec=pays the full undisputed portion of the invoice by the due date;

6.2.sec=provides {_Provider} with a written statement and supporting documentation regarding the dispute within 30 days from the date of the relevant invoice; and

6.3.sec=negotiates in good faith  with {_Provider} to resolve the dispute.

6.00.sec=If the {_Customer} disputes any portion of an invoice that is based upon {_Service} usage or availability, then {_Provider}'s records of such usage or availability shall be presumed to be accurate unless proved otherwise by an independent auditor. If the dispute has not been resolved within 30 days from the {_Customer}’s original written claim, then either party may pursue its rights or remedies in the manner set forth in {Dispute.Xref}.

7.Ti=Taxes

7.sec=All {_Charges} are calculated exclusive of any {_Taxes}, whether charged to {_Provider} or the {_Customer}, based on the provision of the {_Service} to the {_Customer} and/or the {_Customer}’s use of the {_Service}. The {_Customer} is responsible for payment of all {_Taxes}.  VAT will be invoiced in accordance with statutory requirements for such tax and shall be payable, subject to receipt by the {_Customer} of a valid VAT invoice. If the {_Customer} is required to pay a {_Tax} pursuant to this {Billing.Xref}.7, then the {_Customer} shall pay such amounts as are necessary to ensure that the net amounts received by {_Provider} after all such payments or withholdings equal the amount to which {_Provider} is otherwise entitled to under the {_Agreement} as if such {_Taxes} did not exist.

8.Ti=Fraudulent Use

8.sec=The {_Customer} will be responsible for all {_Charges} incurred in respect of the {_Service} even if such {_Charges} were incurred through, or as a result of, fraudulent or unauthorised use of the {_Service}. {_Provider} may, but is not obliged to, detect unauthorised or fraudulent use of the {_Service}.
