Ti=Termination and Suspension

1.Ti=Termination by the Customer

1.sec=The {_Customer} may terminate the {_Agreement} without liability on {TerminationByCustomer.ForBreachByProvider.TimeSpan} written notice to {_Provider} if: (a) {_Provider} commits a material breach of the {_Agreement} and, in the case of a breach capable of remedy has not cured such breach or omission within {TerminationByCustomer.ForBreachByProvider.CurePeriod.TimeSpan} after receipt of written notice from the {_Customer}; or (b) {_Provider} suffers or undergoes an {_Event_of_Insolvency}.

2.Ti=Termination or Suspension by Provider

2.sec={_Provider} may terminate the {_Agreement} and/or  cease or suspend the provision of {_Service} upon written notice to the {_Customer} if: (a) the {_Customer} fails to pay any {_Charges} when due and does not cure the failure within {TerminationByProvider.ForFailureToPayByCustomer.CurePeriod.TimeSpan} of the notice; (b) the {_Customer}'s unpaid balance or use of the {_Service} exceeds the {_Customer}'s credit limit (if any); (c) if the {_Customer} commits a breach of {CustomerObligation.Xref}; (d) the {_Customer} commits a breach of the {_Agreement} (other than a non-payment or {CustomerObligation.Xref}  breach) and does not cure such breach within {TerminationByProvider.ForBreachByCustomer.CurePeriod.TimeSpan} of written notice from {_Provider}; (e) the {_Customer} makes a material misrepresentation in any submission to {_Provider}; (f) the {_Customer} suffers or undergoes an {_Event_of_Insolvency}; or (g) the provision of {_Service} is determined by any governmental or legal authority to be contrary to any law, rule, policy or regulation.

3.Ti=Cancellation Charges

3.sec=If the {_Customer} cancels a {_Service} prior to the conclusion of its {_Service_Term}, then the {_Customer} shall pay to {_Provider} all {_Charges} for the {_Service} provided up until the effective date of such cancellation plus a cancellation charge as follows: (a) if the {_Service} is cancelled after the {_Agreement} is signed but prior to the {_Service_Commencement_Date}, then the cancellation charge will be an amount equal to {Charge.ServiceCancellationBeforeCommencement.cl}; and (b) if the {_Service} is cancelled after the {_Service_Commencement_Date} but prior to the end of the {_Service_Term}, then the cancellation charge will be an amount equal to {Charge.ServiceCancellationBeforeCommencement.cl}. All cancellation charges shall be paid within {Charge.ServiceCancellation.PaymentDueWithin.TimeSpan} of receipt of invoice. Both parties acknowledge and agree that the above cancellation charges are a genuine pre-estimate of {_Provider}â€™s loss in the event that the {_Customer} were to terminate a {_Service} prior to the end of the {_Service_Term} and that they are not intended as a penalty. The cancellation charges provided in this {AgtStop.Xref}.3 shall not apply if the {_Customer} cancels a {_Service} pursuant to {ProvideService.Xref}.3 or {AgtStop.Xref}.1.

4.Ti=Obligations upon Termination or Suspension

4.sec=Neither the termination of the {_Agreement} nor the suspension or cancellation of any {_Service} for any reason shall relieve the {_Customer} of its obligation to pay all {_Charges} for {_Service} accrued and owing up to and including the date of termination, suspension or cancellation or otherwise payable pursuant to  the {_Agreement}. In addition, such termination, suspension or cancellation shall not preclude {_Provider} from pursuing any other remedies available to it at law or in equity. If {_Provider} has terminated this {_MSA} or suspended or terminated any {_Service} or {_Agreement}, then the {_Customer} agrees to pay {_Provider} a reconnection fee, if {_Provider} agrees to reactivate the {_Service}. The amount of any such reconnection fee shall be determined by {_Provider} at its sole discretion.
