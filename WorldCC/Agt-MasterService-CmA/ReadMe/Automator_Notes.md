Automator's notes:

There is something subtle going on in the difference of the use of "MSA" and "Agreement".  "MSA" appears to mean the master agreement, while "Agreement" means the MSA and the subsequent engagements of the parties.  We need to keep an eye on the use of these two terms.

"Provider" is said to mean the entity providing the Service.  Watch for confusion with the "Provider" as party to the MSA.

Service {_Charge}

In defined terms - inconsistency: "shall mean" should be "means"

"Equipment" seems too general.  Perhaps "Provided Equipment"
