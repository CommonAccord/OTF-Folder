/=To demonstrate the flexibility of Prose Objects, we now strengthen the treatment of Confidentiality by including the more extensive Confidentiality provisions and a more extensive definition of "Confidential Information."  We do that by referencing objects from the Agt-NDA-CmA form that originated with CooleyGo (but is substantially modified).  We override the definition of Confidential Information and the Section on Confidentiality.

Conf.Life.sec={Conf.Life.Alt1.sec}

Conf.Engage.Access.Cond.sec={Conf.Engage.Access.Cond.Alt2.sec}

Conf.Engage.Access.Role.sec={Conf.Engage.Access.Role.Alt3.sec}

Conf.Engage.Access.sec={Conf.Engage.Access.Alt2.sec}
