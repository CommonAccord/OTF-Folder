This is a list of some contract sections that are used as bricks in making agreements. The sections are organized by subject matter and sometimes by type of use. <br>The subject matters are organized into some very broad groups - Definition, Focus, Interpretation, Miscellaneous, Relationship and Whereas.  (Def/Focus/Interprete/Misc/Relate/Why)<br>
A leading hyphen (e.g., -Consult) indicates a variant on the subject.  The absence of a hyphen indicates a sub-subject.
