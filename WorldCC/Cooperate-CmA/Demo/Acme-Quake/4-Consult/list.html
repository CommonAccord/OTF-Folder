The Consulting Agreement builds on the Cooperation Agreement, but adds and overrides many provisions.  For instance, the Focus of the document is Services and Compensation.  The Relationship section has many changes and additions.  For the changes in each section, their is corresponding page that specifies the changes to the section.  For instance, follow the changes for Relate.Own.Sec.  This also allows the adapted section to be reused in other kinds of agreements where that configuration of provisions might be useful.
