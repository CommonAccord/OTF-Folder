Ti=Term

sec=The term of {_this_Agreement} ("{_Term}") shall begin on the "{_Effective_Date}" and end on {Term.End.YMD} ("{_Expiration_Date}"), unless sooner terminated as provided in Section {Expire.Xnum}. If signed after the {_Effective_Date}, {_this_Agreement} shall be deemed retroactive to the {_Effective_Date}. The parties further agree that if any {PO_or_SOW} is in effect at the time of the expiration of {_this_Agreement}, then as it applies to such {PO_or_SOW} only, the {_Term} of {_this_Agreement} will be extended until the expiration or termination of such {PO_or_SOW}.
