This little demo shows four steps in a purchasing arrangement between a restaurant and a food supplier in Dublin. <br>
The business managers of the two companies decide to use a standard - the Dublin Food Supply model.  <br>
In Step 1 - They create a "Connection" - by listing their companies and referencing the model.<br>
In Step 2 - They specify some matters like time for payment and place for deliveries.<br>
In Step 3 - They sign. (In real use there would be separate steps for each signature.)<br>
In Step 4 - The purchasing agent places an order for vegetables. (The example would be more compelling if it involved beer.)
